# FDA-TOP-Sprint

support for 2023 FDA TOP challenge

## Project wrap-up

From team lead, Matt Deady, on Slack, October 12, 2023:

> I wanted to recognize several IBMers ( @huangha,@Ali Hashmi,@jbeers) who did a great job participating in The Opportunity Project for FDA and @qingying.lu and @Becca who gave us guidance throughout the project. This is a series of sprints where the team interviewed state, local, community and tribal public health workers to understand their pain points and how technology and open source data provided by the US census solutions could help them out. Our solution was to use the SHAPE app developed on the BEST project to help our users collect data for populations that are difficult to collect data for like rural and migratory groups.
> We just finished presenting our MVP to a collection of FDA, census and representative users and will present again at a showcase in October. Here is a recording of the presentation. Let us know if you have any questions or know any clients that may be interested in attending the showcase or learning more!
> Hello all the IBM Opportunity Project team  are presenting in a lighting talks showcase on 10/20... Use this link to sign up <https://2023topdiagnosticdatashowcase.splashthat.com/>
